As a university student who spends a lot of time online, I’ve noticed some common risks that can affect anyone. Based on my experience and observations, here are the top five cyber threats students should be aware of, along with simple tips to stay safe.

## 1. Phishing Attacks

### What it is:

- Fake emails or links pretending to be from banks, lecturers, or services (e.g., Netflix).
- Often ask you to log in, reset a password, or claim an offer.
- **Goal**: steal your personal information.

### Why students fall for it:

- We’re usually busy, so it easy to click without checking.
- Offers like internships or jobs can trick students actively searching for opportunities.

### How to mitigate it:

- Check the sender’s email address carefully.
- Hover over links before clicking.
- Avoid suspicious attachments.
- If unsure, confirm through the official site or lecturer instead of trusting the message.

> The above email was received by my friend, claiming to offer an internship. At first glance it looks real, but after the greeting, there’s no name, no website, and no proper contact details. These are clear signs of a phishing or scam email, so it’s best to avoid and delete it.

## 2. Weak Passwords

### What it is:

- Weak passwords are easy to guess and often reused across multiple accounts.
- Many students choose simple combinations like their name, DOB, NIC, or even their parents’ or partner’s name.

### Why students fall for it:

- It feels convenient to use personal details because they’re easy to remember.
- In a university setting, these details can be easy to find, so someone could guess a password with just a few tries.

### How to mitigate it:

- Use strong, unique passwords for each account.
- Add a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols to make them harder to guess.
- Consider using a password manager to safely store complex passwords instead of relying on memory.

> The above image shows a tool called CUPP. It asks for personal details of a person and then generates password combinations based on the information provided.

> Within seconds, it generated 11,698 possible combinations. While it doesn’t guarantee your exact password will be included, using weak passwords still carries a high risk of being guessed.

## 3. Public Wi-Fi Risks

### What it is:

- Public Wi-Fi can be risky because hackers may create fake networks with names that look real, like “Campus Wi-Fi” or “CoffeeShop Free Wi-Fi.”
- Connecting to these networks lets attackers see the data you send, including passwords or messages.

### Why students fall for it:

- It’s convenient and free, and mobile data is expensive in Sri Lanka.
- When rushing to check emails or submit assignments, it’s easy to ignore security warnings.

### How to mitigate it:

- Avoid logging into sensitive accounts on public Wi-Fi.
- Make sure any website you use has HTTPS.
- Connect only to trusted networks to keep data safe.

> The below image shows a Wi-Fi connection I replicated from the real “SLIIT-STD” network. If you look closely, there’s no lock icon, but most people don’t notice and may connect, which can put their data at risk.

> As shown in the image above, I replicated the exact UI of the “SLIIT-STD” network. But if you look closely, the IP is not auth.sliit.lk it’s just 4.3.2.1. Most people probably wouldn’t notice this, and after they enter their username and password and click the continue button, I can see their credentials in my console.

## 4. Malware and Viruses

### What it is:

- Malware is software designed to harm your device or steal your data.
- It can hide in downloads, cracked software, or fake apps that look useful.

### Why students fall for it:

- Many students, including my friends and I, sometimes play cracked games or download free apps and assignments without checking the source.
- It’s tempting to click “download” quickly, especially when deadlines are near, which can lead to accidentally installing malware.

### How to mitigate it:

- Only download files from trusted websites.
- Keep antivirus software updated.
- Avoid unknown links and check reviews before downloading anything.

> The image above shows a shortcut that looks like it links to a game, but its actual target is a batch script.

> When I check the batch script, it runs both the game and another malicious encoded shell script.

## 5. Social Media Exploits & OSINT

### What it is:

- **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)** is gathering information from publicly available sources, like social media posts, photos, or public records.
- Hackers can use this info to learn a lot about you without hacking your accounts directly.

### Why students fall for it:

- Many students share personal details online, such as birthdays, hobbies, locations, or school info, without realizing it.
- Hackers can combine these details to create convincing scams.
- Exposed information can be used to impersonate you, make purchases in your name, open fake accounts, or target you in scams
- In real-world cases, attackers have used publicly available info to steal identities, manipulate social media, or even commit financial fraud.

### How to mitigate it:

- Be careful about what you post and think before sharing personal info.
- Being aware of what’s publicly visible reduces the risk of exploitation.

> The above image shows a popular tool called Maltego. I just entered my email and name, then ran two transformers to get my Twitter and Instagram accounts. There are hundreds of transformers available, which can find a range of details about a person from low critical data like hobbies and social media activity to high-critical data such as job info and publicly available documents.

## Conclusion

As a university student, I’ve realized that spending time online comes with real risks. From phishing emails and weak passwords to public Wi-Fi, malware, and social media exploits, students can easily fall victim if they’re not careful. By being aware of these threats, thinking before clicking links, sharing personal info or downloading files, we can protect ourselves and reduce the chances of scams, identity theft or other cybercrimes. Staying informed and cautious online is the best way to stay safe in today’s digital world.
